# Word_to_Word
 
This Java program is a tool that finds the shortest path of transformations between two words of the same length. It uses a dictionary of words and considers a transformation valid if it changes one letter and the new word is in the dictionary.

User Instructions:

When prompted, input the start word.
Next, input the target word.
The program will display the shortest path of transformations and its length.
To try again with different words, repeat steps 2-4.
To exit the program, input ‘1’ when prompted for the start or target word.
